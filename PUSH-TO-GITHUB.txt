After you create the GitHub repository at https://github.com/new:

Repository name: smartqr-ai
Make it: Public
Click: Create repository

Then I will automatically run:
git push -u origin main

And your complete SmartQR.ai application will be on GitHub!

After that, we can deploy to Netlify in 1 minute.
